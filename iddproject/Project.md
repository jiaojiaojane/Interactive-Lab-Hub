Christmas Advent Calendar

 building a Christmas Advent calendar to count the days of advent to Christmas from December 1st to Christmas Eve. Users could open a “calendar door” every day to reveal a different Christmas song. We would use two touch sensors to detect the day user’s trying to see and use the webcam to play the song. We will also use an OLED display to display the days left until Christmas. 
 
Timeline

Nov 18th: Confirm project idea
Nov 25th: Assemble and order needed parts/sensor, foundational coding parts 
Dec 2th: Furthur coding parts for essential functions, e.g. reading data from sensors, showing data on raspberry pi screen interface 
Dec 9th: 1) Testing; 2) Adding button, Joystick, LED and interaction of them 
Dec 16th: Finalize documents and coding, final Project Deadline 

Parts needed

1 x Raspberry Pi 4 Computer Kit
1 x Adafruit MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor QT
1 x Adafruit Mini PiTFT
1 x SparkFun Qwiic OLED Display
1 x Copper Foil Tape
1 x Raspberry Pi 4 Power Supply with USB C
1 x 32GB MicroSD Cards w/ Card Reader

Risks/contingencies
We may need two to three touch sensors to have each calendar day match to an individual hole on the touch sensor. There’s the risk that the Raspberry Pi couldn’t detect multiple touch sensors at the same time, or give inaccurate touch results.
The copper foil tape may need to be sticked on the back of the cardboard sticker in a certain way to be conductive and readable to the whole calendar.
The joystick may not give accurate results with the user's manipulation on the time, ex. The users may accidentally push up or down when they want to adjust the appointment time that would result in logging a wrong time. 

Fall-back plan
If the interaction has some unexpected difficulty or if the Joystick part function couldn’t run as we expected, we will simplify the device to only play the Christmas song once so that we will have the MVP product to allow raspberry pi read the date from users’ mark on the deadline.
